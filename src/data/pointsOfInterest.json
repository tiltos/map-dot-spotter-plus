    "description": "Eldnavir, “The Old Neck,” is both lifeline and pressure point. Built upon stone causeways from the Age of Giants, it houses a vibrant market town fortified with black-timber palisades. Merchants, mercenaries, pilgrims, and outlaws alike pass through here. Beneath the cobbled streets, it is said there are old barrows sealed with rune-iron — occasionally one breaks open. The town watch is strong, but overworked, and superstition runs thick as trade.",

They are friendly — for now — but their skalds tell of an old debt owed to a “Bone-King” in the east.",

Lord Heigrim the Blacktooth still lives — or something that bears his name does. The villagers cling to his protection, though they no longer speak of the manor’s west wing.",

Smoke rises from peat fires, and lanterns of green glass glow even when the wind is still.\n\nThe people of Drevask rarely smile, but they do not turn travelers away — especially those who carry weapons. Every house has a sprig of pine nailed above the door and a shallow bowl of black salt beneath the threshold.",

With a word, a Fey queen could ravage a land with storms, or scorch it with sun. However, as the old gods emerged, the Fey had to relinquish more and more of their power, driving them back into the deep forests and the snow-capped mountains.\n\nAcross the land, the Ice-heart Court seeks to reclaim their ancient rights. Their terrible queen seeks to plunge the world into a perpetual winter where she would become powerful enough to challenge the gods themselves.",

In the old times, a great war was fought over these lands, between what scholars call the ‘Morning People’, and a far more ancient force that resided here.\n\nThe war ended with the Morning People being cursed and banished from the surface world, dwelling underground as the curse ate away at their sanity and their very form. Now, their bestial forms have returned to reclaim the surface world, by blade and by spell.",

The Dusklings themselves rarely speak of their origins, placing little value in it, but feel a strong affinity for the night. Duskling priests emphasize the role of their people in maintaining the balance between the physical world and the fey realms.",

A hunter named **Ingril Harrowborn** stumbled into the village with a broken spear and black mud caked beneath her nails. She spoke of shadows with crooked limbs retreating into the deeper wood, dragging bloodied sacks behind them.\n\nThe enemy was no wandering threat — it was an **Ice-heart warband**, goblin-things of the **Frozen Fey**, returning from a raid. Smoke had been seen deep within Huskuld’s Hook, rising not from homes but from old ruins once **choked in vine and silence**. There, the raiders had paused — not to flee, but to **dig**, to spread their roots into Skarnheim’s wounded soil.\n\nSomething else moves among them: a thing **not goblin**, but **worse**. An **Infernal Spawn**, animated by breach and blood, drawn across worlds by hatred and hunger. It wears no name, but **it knows yours** — or someone in your kin’s line — and it has waited long to strike.\n\nBefore you left, a quiet woodsman in Drevask pressed something into your hand — a **birch-bark map** and whispered:\n\n> “There's a wooden box in those ruins. Leave it if you like, but if you find it, don't open it until night.”",
